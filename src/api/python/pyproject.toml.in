# The format of the following license attribute is deprecated

# license = {text = "BSD-3-Clause AND LGPL-3.0-or-later AND MIT"}

# The following license attribute uses the new format introduced by PEP 639,
# which requires Setuptools >= 77.0.0 and Python >= 3.9:
# license = "BSD-3-Clause AND LGPL-3.0-or-later AND MIT"

# Until we adopt Python >= 3.9 and Setuptools >= 77.0.0, we omit this attribute
# and instead provide license information only via files specified in setup.py
